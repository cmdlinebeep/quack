# Project 2 -- Quack

#### Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Quack is a spin on the popular messaging/chat/productivity/time-waster app, Slack.  Users can join public rooms or "channels" and post and read content
shared there.  In this app, they can also private message another user by clicking on them.

I had fun with this assignment.  My big challenge to myself was to make the page look good on both desktop and mobile.  You be the judge, but I think it hits
that goal.  When the view is small, a vertical ellipsis icon expands the menu on mobile.  This menu can also be "dragged out" from the side.  

The personalization I added was the ability to Private Message.  I found this to be the most challenging part of this particular project.
